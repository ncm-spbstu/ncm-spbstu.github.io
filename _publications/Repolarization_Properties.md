The present paper investigates the dielectric and repolarization properties of ferroelectric SiO<sub>2</sub> – NaNO<sub>2</sub> and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> – NaNO<sub>2</sub> composites. It is found that the behavior of the main electrical characteristics is affected by the size of ferroelectric particles and their relative positions in the dielectric matrix.

The AC electrical conductivity (σ) of polycrystalline NaNO<sub>2</sub> and SiO<sub>2</sub>-NaNO<sub>2</sub> composite, prepared by embedding of sodium nitrite into porous glasses with 7, 46 and 320 nm average pore diameter, have been studied at frequencies of 0.1 Hz–1 MHz within temperature range of 300–500 К. It was found a considerable increase of σ in sodium nitrite inclusions under restricted geometry conditions. A study of frequency dependences of σ shows a strong contribution of hopping mechanism to total electrical conductivity. The trend to reduction of activation energy of σ with decreasing of matrix pore diameter was revealed..

Ultra broad band dielectric and conduction spectroscopy with temperature control system and a system of visualization and data treatment.
Complex system of ‘ready-to-use” type NOVOCONTROL CONCEPT-80 includes low and high frequency spectrometer BDS-80 (from 3 μHz - 20 MHz ) for dielectric, electrochemical impedance and conduction spectroscopy developed especially for materials investigation in combination with the QUATRO Cryosystem (-160 °C ... 400 °C) and a program complex for visualization and treatment of data. At the same time, the device provides high measurement accuracy: the relative measurement errors of impedance and capacitance and the absolute value of tanδ are less than 3 * 10<sup>-5</sup>. The temperature is kept stable within 0.1 K.

### Specification and  Technical Characteristics:

- Frequency range 3*10<sup>-5<sup> .. 2*10<sup>7</sup> Hz including low frequencies characterizing possesses of dielectric relaxation.
- Ultra broad range of altering Capacity 10*<sup>-15</sup> - 1 F allows conducting broad band measurements until exceptionally low capacity values.
- Ultra high range of Impedance measurement 0.01 - 1014 Ω covers region from semiconductors to isolators.
- Loss factor tan(δ) accuracy < 3*10<sup>-5</sup>, resolution 10<sup>-5</sup>.
- Supports a number of measuring interfaces for users with special functions.
- Supports non-linear dielectric, impedance spectroscopy and spectroscopy of non-linear conduction in combination with any measuring interface.
- Includes sample cell and a special high voltage sample cell.
- Supports up to 157 point during high voltage measurements per second (impedance measurements) through GPIB port.
- Automated self-calibration and user diagnostic.

Ultra broad band dielectric and conduction spectroscopy with temperature control system and a system of visualization and data treatment. Complex system of ‘ready-to-use” type NOVOCONTROL CONCEPT-80 includes low and high frequency spectrometer BDS-80 (from 3 μHz - 20 MHz ) for dielectric, electrochemical impedance and conduction spectroscopy developed especially for materials investigation in combination with the QUATRO Cryosystem (-160 °C ... 400 °C) and a program complex for visualization and treatment of data.

### Technical feature of BDS-80:

- Frequency range 3E-5 .. 2E7 Hz including low frequencies characterizing possesses of dielectric relaxation.
- Ultra broad range of altering Capacity E-15 .. 1 F allows conducting broad band measurements until exceptionally low capacity values.
- Ultra high range of Impedance measurement 0.01 - 1014 Ω covers region from semiconductors to isolators.
- Loss factor tan(δ) accuracy < 3E-5, resolution E-5
- Supports a number of measuring interfaces for users with special functions.
- Supports non-linear dielectric, impedance spectroscopy and spectroscopy of non-linear conduction in combination with any measuring interface.
- Includes sample cell and a special high voltage sample cell
- Supports up to 157 point during high voltage measurements per second (impedance measurements) through GPIB port
- Automated self-calibration and user diagnostic

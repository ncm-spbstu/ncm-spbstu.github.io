MiniLab 080 is ideally suited to evaporation techniques where long working distances are required for best uniformity, and where evaporant incident angles close to 90Â° allow for optimal results for lift-off applications.


### Specification and  Technical Characteristics:
MiniLab 080 allows to implement all vacuum deposition processes from any sources (up to 4 standard resistive sources, or a high-current resistive source with a closed loop) in manual or semi-automatic modes. The unit's chamber (front-loading stainless steel) has sufficient height (550 mm), making it ideal for use with an electron beam source and for use with low-temperature resistive sources (LTE).

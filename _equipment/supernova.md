SuperNova is the latest generation of dual fixed wavelength systems and leverages all the advances in Agilent Technologies' Gemini system with two different x-ray sources. The system is designed for precision research of single crystals with large cells, including biological macromolecular structures.

### Specification and  Technical Characteristics:
- Anode materials: microfocus radiation sources - MoKα, CuKα;
- Nominal operating mode of X-ray sources: 40 kV / 1.5 mA;
- Reflected X-ray detector: two-dimensional high-speed CCD;
- Multilayer X-ray optics to increase the intensity and serve as a monochromator;
- Geometry of the survey: 4-circle KAPPA goniometer with a variable angle of crystal rotation around the axis of the goniometric head (χ):
	- range of angle change 2ϴ from -180 to + 215 °;
	- free rotation along the angle ω;
	- measurement step along the 2ϴ and ω axes no more than 0.00125 degrees;
	- resolution for molybdenum radiation no more than 0.40 Å in the range from 130 to 135° at 2θ.
- Low temperature Oxford Cryosystems Cobra with a temperature range of 80 - 500 K.
- Video microscope, fixed directly to the goniometer and equipped with means for measuring the geometric dimensions of the analyzed samples with an accuracy of 10 μm.

### Software:
The specialized CRYSALISpro software package allows you to automatically search for diffraction peaks with specified parameters, automatically determine and refine the unit cell parameters, integrate an array of diffraction data, analyze and process diffuse scattering data, take into account absorption by the real crystal shape, numerically account for absorption, scaling and accounting absorption based on the intensity data of symmetrically coupled reflections measured at different crystal orientations; calculation of geometric characteristics of objects (area, perimeter, shape factor, orientation, length, width).

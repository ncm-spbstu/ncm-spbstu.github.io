*Research and Education center (REC) “Physics of Nanocomposite Materials” (NCM)* -- is a structural subdivision of St.Petersburg State Polytechnical University, created in 2005 on the bases of research and education laboratory *“Physics of nanocomposite materials of electronics”* is a joint project of physical electronics department of *Radio Physical Faculty SPbSTU* and *Ioffe Institute* and *Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute of Russian academy of Science.* 
Major objective of REC is the investigation and development of new nanocomposite materials for electronic industry and specialist training capable of creating such materials and technologies single-handedly. Among the objective of laboratory was holding graduate students in sciences and research sector. 
REC is a joint project of largest scientific and educational centers of region, which gives an opportunity for new coming students, PhD students and young members to participate in “Tomorrow’s objectives”.

Major scientific directions of REC NCM are creation and investigation of:

- self-organized nanostructured materials for electronics.
- Artificial nanocomposite structure on the bases of dielectric matrixes. 

All accomplishments of REC are the result of co-operation between students, Phs students and leading Russian scientists. Large attention is payed to internation co-operation in which at all times young scientists participate. Students and PhD students of REC took part in many experiments in leading research centers of Germany, France and Japan, they have done a number of reports at largest international conferences.

Based on experimental bases REC has the opportunity to use:

- Methods of impedance spectroscopy (conductivity, dielectric response) in frequency range 10<sup>-6</sup> Hz – 10<sup>7</sup> Hz in interval of temperature 3.5 К – 700 К, including the interval 3.5 К – 300 К in magnetic fields up to 9 T.
- Methods of probe microscopy in the temperature interval 3.5 К – 300 К in magnetic fields up to 9.5 T.
- Methods of inelastic neutron scattering to investigate atomic dynamics.
- Methods of neutron diffraction to investigate crystallographic and magnetic structure.
